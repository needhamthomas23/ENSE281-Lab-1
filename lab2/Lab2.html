<h2>CHAPTER I</h2>

<h4>JONATHAN HARKER’S JOURNAL</h4>

<em>(Kept in shorthand.)</em>

<p><em>3 May. Bistritz.</em>—Left Munich at 8:35 P. M., on 1st May, arriving at Vienna early next morning;
should have arrived at 6:46, but train was an hour late. Buda-Pesth seems a wonderful place, 
from the glimpse which I got of it from the train and the little I could walk through the streets.
I feared to go very far from the station, as we had arrived late and would start as near the correct time as possible.
The impression I had was that we were leaving the West and entering the East; the most western of splendid bridges over the Danube, 
which is here of noble width and depth, took us among the traditions of Turkish rule.</p>
